# AICC

A command line tool to convert an image type to another. **AICC** stands for **All Image Conversion Command**.

## How do I use this?

Add the program to your computers user `PATH` so you can use it from any directory.
Once you've done that, you can run it through the command line itself.

`aicc <path-to-file that needs conversion> <path-to-file that the converted file should be saved to> <file extension to convert to>`

## What are all the features of this command?

### Current Features
Conversions from:
- file to file
- link to file

### Features Coming Soon
Conversions from:
- file to directory
- directory to directory

## How do I build this script on my own?

 Use [pyinstaller](https://pypi.org/project/pyinstaller/)! I've provided a reference to building the script [here](https://github.com/sid-the-loser/AICC/blob/main/build.sh) for **linux** and [here](https://github.com/sid-the-loser/AICC/blob/main/build.bat) for **windows**.
